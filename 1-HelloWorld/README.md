# Hello, World!

It's time for everyone's favorite programming exercise: the hello world program!  You'll write a program that prints
`Hello, world!` to the terminal!

`HelloWorld.py` is a file that contains a python program.  You can run it on your own machine by opening your terminal,
`cd`ing into the directory containing it, and running the following command (not including the preceding `$`):

```
$ python3 HelloWorld.py
```

You will see the following two lines, one of which should be empty, appear in your terminal:
```
This is a print statement!

```

Let's take a look at how this is working.  To do so, go ahead and open HelloWorld.py.  I'll explain more once you're
there!
